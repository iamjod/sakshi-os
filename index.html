                <p>Dear Sakshi,

22 looks good on you. I know I don't say it often, but you've grown into someone really special. 

I've watched you handle tough days with grace, laugh at the stupidest jokes, and somehow still tolerate my nonsense. That takes patience I'll never understand.

You make ordinary days feel less ordinary. Whether it's our random 2 AM conversations or just sharing memes that make no sense to anyone else - these are the moments I value most.

I'm not great at this whole "expressing feelings" thing. But I want you to know: you matter. Your happiness matters. Your peace matters. 

Here's to another year of you being you.

- Aarav <br> Yes, I actually took time to make this website. No, I don't expect a thank you. Okay, maybe a small one.</p>
                <p>This is the first app of the website, and probably you're reading this one in the first place, I hope you like it, it took me... I don't know how many days, I started this before the economics exam... so I don't know how many days, it's 4 Oct today, when I'm writing this.</p>

            <h4>Chapter 1: The Beginning</h4>
            <p>
                I don't know if you remember, but we met around the time you were almost Legend. 
                The first converstaion was about reaching Legend on the same day, which didn't happen, erm

            </p>
            <p>
                Mika used to be decently active, and you were too but not that much.. yeah
            </p>

        <div class="story-chapter">
            <h4>Chapter 2: The Growing Years</h4>
            <p>
                Fast forwarding to a new Gartic era, you, me, Slay, Fur, Cosmic, Glasses became a new squad.
            Y'all used to play in GarticBr too much, and I used to join sometimes. But I didn't like playing there much bcs I wanted xp.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was the most active and you were the least, I don't know if we used to talk that much, but we did talk quite a bit
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-chapter">
            <h4>Chapter 3: God knows what</h4>
            <p>
                I don't know why and when we even got closer, I randomly asked you weren't you dating Aryan AGAIN, and you told me the thing
                and I became your therapist, and still am to this day. I don't know why you tell me all this stuff, but I'm glad you do.
            </p>
            <p>
               We used to fight too, maybe a bit too much, I don't even remember at this point how much we use to fight, but it was definitely a lot
               . But we'd just talk after a while and forget everything, and go back to being normal. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Then I started dating and told you about everything I'd spam your dms with what I think, what I overthink and you taught me a bit of
               girl's psychology, which I still don't understand, plus I don't remember nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although you never told me about your day, I realised this when I broke up with flower, then I think I stopped teling you stuff
                and then you started dating, then I just stopped talking at all, because.. well I felt like you'd tell him stuff and maybe
                I was forcing you to talk to me, so I just stopped. But I still cared. 
            </p>

        <div class="story-chapter">
            <h4>Chapter 4: The untold</h4>
            <p>
                I've mentioned this many times but I don't like talking with people who're dating, I don't know why, but yes.
            </p>
            <p>
               I don't know how to explain it, but it just feels different. Maybe it's the fear of losing you to someone else, or maybe it's just the way relationships change people.
               But I definitely felt you're not talking, as much, if I don't dm first. I felt replacable, and I thought of not bothering you, anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
                You blocked me, for whatever reason, I was sad, you didn't come to wish me birthday, didn't come when I needed you the most, I was sad, I was overwhelmed, but I never told anyone about it
                not you, not anyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe I was jealous, maybe I was selfish to ask you stay, so I didn't. But that was all I ever wanted, it remained unsaid
                until.. now
            </p>

            <h4>Chapter 5: The now</h4>
            <p>
               
            </p>
            <p>
              Well, now everything is different. I've changed, although you're the same. I'm more open now, I don't go hiding stuff, okay, maybe sometimes
                but I try to be more open. I don't know if you even care, but I do. 
            </p>
            <p>
               We talk.. more than ever, and I'm glad we do, and I hope we always will.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I want from you is.. You, just you, nothing more, nothing less, just you, you, and you. 
                Maybe I'm selfish to ask this, but I really want you, I really love, and care for you, and I always will. I want you to be there for me, just like I want to be there for you. So please
                stay with me.. until faith do us apart.
